# `src/AOtoMO/AOtoMO.f90`

## Overview

This file contains the `AOtoMO` subroutine, which performs the transformation of a matrix from the Atomic Orbital (AO) basis to the Molecular Orbital (MO) basis. This is a common operation in quantum chemistry calculations. The transformation is defined as M_MOs = C<sup>T</sup> * M_AOs * C, where C is the matrix of MO coefficients.

## Key Components

*   **Subroutine `AOtoMO`**
    *   Description: Performs the AO to MO transformation of a given matrix `M_AOs` using the provided MO coefficient matrix `C`. The result is stored in `M_MOs`.
    *   Type: Subroutine
    *   Key Arguments/Parameters:
        *   `nBas` (Integer, Input): The number of atomic basis functions.
        *   `nOrb` (Integer, Input): The number of molecular orbitals.
        *   `C(nBas,nOrb)` (Double Precision, Input): The matrix of MO coefficients.
        *   `M_AOs(nBas,nBas)` (Double Precision, Input): The matrix in the AO basis to be transformed.
        *   `M_MOs(nOrb,Orb)` (Double Precision, Output): The resulting matrix in the MO basis.
    *   Return Value: None.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   **`AC(:,:)`**
    *   Description: An allocatable array used as a temporary matrix to store the intermediate product `M_AOs * C`.
    *   Type: Double Precision, Allocatable 2D Array
    *   Scope: Local to Subroutine `AOtoMO`.

## Usage Examples

```fortran
! Example of how to call SUBROUTINE AOtoMO
! Assuming nBas, nOrb are defined, and C, M_AOs, M_MOs are declared appropriately
CALL AOtoMO(nBas, nOrb, C, M_AOs, M_MOs)
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **Internal Dependencies:**
    *   This specific file does not show `USE` statements for internal modules, as it contains a single subroutine.
*   **External Libraries:**
    *   `dgemm`: This routine (likely from BLAS/LAPACK) is called to perform general matrix-matrix multiplications (`M_AOs * C` and `transpose(C) * AC`).
*   **Interactions:**
    *   This subroutine is expected to be called by other parts of the quantum chemistry program whenever a matrix needs to be transformed from the AO basis to the MO basis.
